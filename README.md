# SleepHelper-Garden

A useful tool to keep your garden watered.  I have a zone in my Rachio watering system dedicated to my garden.  The Boron will send a webhook to the Rachio system using their API to initiate a watering session for the plants.

* Revision history
* v0.01 - Began with the generic Sleep-Helper-Demo code
